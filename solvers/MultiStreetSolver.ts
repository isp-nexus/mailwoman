/**
 * If a 'multistreet' classification was detected then add a new solution which covers all streets
 * included.
 *
 * The ExclusiveCartesianSolver ensures that each public classification can exist only once per
 * solution (ie. we can't have two postalcodes).
 *
 * Intersections are the only exception to this rule, so rather than modifying the
 * ExclusiveCartesianSolver we use this solver to create the missing intersection solutions (those
 * with 2x 'street' labels).
 *
 * One of the challenges is that there could be many different interpretations of the admin tokens,
 * so we need to ensure that each of those permutations is also represented by a distinct
 * intersection solution.
 *
 * The solver works by iterating over existing solutions looking for any which identified a street,
 * it then clones that solution, removes any tokens less granular than street and attempts to add
 * the new street token in its place.
 *
 * Care is taken to ensure that the resulting solution does not contain tokens in overlapping
 * positions.
